# Shift-Scroll Fix for macOS
[Download available on CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/shift-scroll-fix)

Shift-Scroll Fix is a very simple mod which fixes an annoying bug ([MC-121772](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-121772)) that causes scrolling to be impossible while holding shift on macOS.

### How does it work?
Holding shift on macOS while scrolling is supposed to make things scroll horizontally. Minecraft versions 1.13 and higher simply ignore horizontal scrolling. This mod detects when you are scrolling horizontally and "converts" it to vertical scrolling, which lets you scroll through your hotbar again while (shift) sneaking for example.

### Installation
Just drag and drop the .jar file in the mods folder, launch the game and you should be able to scroll while holding shift. No dependencies or configuration needed.
